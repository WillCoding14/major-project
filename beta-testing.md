Beta tester #1 - Alonso and Dave

- Bug - player can still jump even when off of a platform - fixed and added visual indicator
- Would be nice to have more visuals - added sprites for background, lava, platforms, and player
- More mechanics instead of just jumping between platforms - added jump reset orbs
- Clean movement

Beta tester #2 - Mom

- Thinks it's a lot of fun
- Doesn't play many computer games so isn't sure what feedback to give
- Try to make it look "prettier" - added sprites for background, lava, platforms, and player

Beta tester #3 - Kati

- Nice to add sound effects - will do my best
- Add finish line/goal (doing this anyway)
- Add start and end screen
