// Problems/Challenges that occured
In this project, it felt like just about everything that could go wrong did indeed go wrong. At first I attempted to use the p5.js collision library and then build my very own physics engine. I put a few hours into trying to make this work but soon realized the difficulty of creating such a thing would be too difficult based on the amount of time I had to work on the project outside of school.

I soon moved on to using p5.play instead of the p5 collision library and at first things went alot smoother. I was picking up how it worked pretty quick and decided it was time to try putting some of it into practice. Unfortunately, I was really struggling with the new syntax and put my focus towards the wrong things. I felt like I was in sort of a loop and ended up "wasting" 10+ hours just writing and rewriting all to end up at the same spot.

Another challenge that occurred was I didn't have a whole lot of opportunities to work on the project outside of school because of my job and some mental health issues that I was battling. This often meant that I would sort of lose track in between work periods and especially in between weekends and come back not remembering everything and having to realearn.

The final sort of challenge that I was facing was more of a mental one. Towards the end of the project my frustration started getting the better of me and working on the project started to become more of a burden than a fun challenge.


//Things I would do differently
One of the main reasons that I think I struggled so much was I was putting my efforts into the wrong parts of the project. At the start I used too much of my time trying to figure out spritesheets and the looks of the game and should have spent more time working on the mechanics.

Another thing I should have done is start with p5.play to begin with, this would have made it easier from the get go and less time would have been wasted.

The final main thing I should have done differently is reach out for help more. Throughout most of the project, I convinced myself that it was important to do it all myself even when I was struggling towards the end.

//Completion

Overall, I got most of the main things done on my needs to have list and none of the things done on my nice to have

I got collision working with p5.play; start, death, and end screens; and an end goal. The two main things I didn't have time for are sound effects/music and making it so there are different screens and levels.
