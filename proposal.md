# Proposal

I will attempt to make a platformer game based on the video game "Jump King"

This game works by having a character that can walk around and jump at different heights based on how long the space key is pressed

At a base level, the goal is simply to climb up a series of obstacles

## Needs to have list

- Working collision where the play can jump between platforms, hit their head on roofs, and bounce off walls
- Different "screens" to jump between
- An end goal
- Start and victory screens

## Nice to have list

- Slopes to slide down
- Gimmicks (ice, wind, longer wind up, etc.)
- Going horizontal between screens instead of just vertical
